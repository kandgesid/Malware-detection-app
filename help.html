            Security breaches due to attacks by malicious software (malware) continue to escalate
            posing a major security concern in this digital age. With many computer users, corporations,
            and governments affected due to an exponential growth in malware attacks. Recent
            malwares use polymorphic, metamorphic, and other invasive techniques to change the
            malware behaviors quickly and to generate a large number of new malwares.Such new
            malwares are predominantly variants of existing malwares.
        </p>
        <p>
            Current malware detection and classification solutions that adopt the static and dynamic
            analysis of malware signatures and behavior patterns are time consuming and have proven
            to be ineffective in identifying and classifying unknown malwares in real-time.We will use
            deep learning based architectures with image processing techniques to learn optimal, high
            level and abstract features to detect and classify malwares. The main advantage of our
            approach is that it can handle packed malware, and can work on various malwares
            irrespective of the operating system.
